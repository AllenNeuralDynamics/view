Instrument and Acquisition View
This repository contains modules for managing and interacting with various instruments and acquisition processes in a voxel-based system. It leverages the napari viewer for visualization and integrates multiple device widgets for controlling different components of the instrument and acquisition.

Features
Instrument View
Logging: Configurable logging setup to monitor and debug the instrumentâ€™s operations.
Device Widgets: Dynamic creation and management of widgets for various devices such as lasers, DAQs, cameras, stages, and more.
Live Streaming: Setup and control of live streaming from cameras, including snapshot functionality.
DAQ Management: Initialization and configuration of DAQs with tasks for both live streaming and data acquisition.
Stage Control: Arrangement and control of stage positions and joystick widgets.
Laser Control: Management of laser widgets and their configurations.
Filter Wheel Control: Stacking and management of filter wheel widgets.
Channel Selection: Widget for selecting which laser to use for live streaming.
Configuration Management: Saving and updating the instrument configuration on application quit.
Acquisition View
Metadata Management: Custom widget for managing metadata related to the acquisition.
Volume Planning: Visualization and planning of acquisition grids, including volume and channel plans.
Operation Widgets: Dynamic creation and management of widgets for various acquisition operations such as writing, transferring, processing, and routines.
Stage Positioning: Live tracking and updating of field-of-view (FOV) positions.
Acquisition Control: Start and stop buttons for controlling the acquisition process.
Configuration Management: Saving and updating the acquisition configuration on application quit.

Usage
Instrument View
To use the InstrumentView class, initialize it with the instrument configuration and desired log level:

Python

from pathlib import Path
from instrument_view import InstrumentView

instrument = ...  # Your instrument object
config_path = Path('path/to/config.yaml')
view = InstrumentView(instrument, config_path, log_level='INFO')
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Acquisition View
To use the AcquisitionView class, initialize it with the acquisition configuration and the instrument view:

Python

from acquisition_view import AcquisitionView

acquisition = ...  # Your acquisition object
instrument_view = ...  # Your instrument view object
acquisition_view = AcquisitionView(acquisition, instrument_view, log_level='INFO')
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Key Methods
Instrument View
setup_daqs(): Initializes DAQs with live streaming tasks.
setup_stage_widgets(): Arranges stage position and joystick widgets.
setup_laser_widgets(): Arranges laser widgets.
setup_daq_widgets(): Sets up DAQ widgets and their configurations.
setup_camera_widgets(): Sets up live view and snapshot buttons for cameras.
setup_channel_widget(): Creates a widget to select which laser to live stream with.
create_device_widgets(device_name, device_specs): Creates widgets based on device specifications.
update_config_on_quit(): Saves device properties to the instrument configuration on application quit.
Acquisition View
create_start_button(): Creates a button to start the acquisition.
create_stop_button(): Creates a button to stop the acquisition.
start_acquisition(): Starts the acquisition process.
acquisition_ended(): Re-enables UI and threads after the acquisition has ended.
stack_device_widgets(device_type): Stacks device widgets in a layout and hides/unhides them with a combo box.
create_metadata_widget(): Creates a custom widget for metadata.
create_acquisition_widget(): Creates a widget to visualize the acquisition grid.
update_config_on_quit(): Saves device properties to the acquisition configuration on application quit.
Signals
Instrument View
snapshotTaken: Emitted when a snapshot is taken.
contrastChanged: Emitted when the contrast of an image changes.
Acquisition View
fovHalt: Emitted to stop the stage.
fovMove: Emitted to move the stage to clicked coordinates.
Example
Instrument View
